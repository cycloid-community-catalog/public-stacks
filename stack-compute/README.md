# Stack-compute

This stack allows to deploy a configure compute instance in one of the available providers.

It allows to configure the Virtual Machine's **definitions**, **OS**, **volume**, **network** and **security**.

To ease the use of the stack, there's a pre-configured ssh access rule that can be disabled in all the providers that can be changed or disabled.

> and click on the `+` button to trigger it.

**Jobs description**

  * `terraform-plan`: Terraform job that will simply make a plan of the stack.
  * `terraform-apply`: Terraform job similar to the plan one, but will actually create/update everything that needs to. Please see the plan diff for a better understanding.
  * `terraform-destroy`: :warning: Terraform job meant to destroy the whole stack - **NO CONFIRMATION ASKED**. If triggered, the full project **WILL** be destroyed. Use with caution.
